# Adult Income Prediction from Census Data

This project focuses on processing and analyzing the Adult Census Income dataset to predict income levels. It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dataset preparation for machine learning models.

## Features
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Feature engineering for better model performance
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Final dataset preparation for machine learning

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization
- Scikit-learn for preprocessing and model preparation

## How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the Adult Census Income dataset.
2. Handle missing and inconsistent data.
3. Perform feature engineering to enhance dataset quality.
4. Analyze data trends and correlations using EDA.
5. Prepare the final dataset for machine learning applications.

## Setup
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
2. Download the Adult Census Income dataset.
3. Run the preprocessing script to generate a cleaned dataset.

## Next Steps
- Train machine learning models for income classification.
- Perform feature selection to optimize model performance.
- Experiment with different algorithms for better accuracy.
